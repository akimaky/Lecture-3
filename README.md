Automatic Semicolon Insertion
Certain ECMAScript statements (empty statement, variable statement, expression statement, do-while statement, continue statement, 
break statement, return statement, and throw statement) must be terminated with semicolons. Such semicolons may always appear 
explicitly in the source text. For convenience, however, such semicolons may be omitted from the source text in certain situations. 
These situations are described by saying that semicolons are automatically inserted into the source code token stream in those situations.
